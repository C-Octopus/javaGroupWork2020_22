Group Work for JAVA Course
This is where Group 22 uploads our Java project content.
We are still beginners in Java.
So, if you have any questions and good ideas, please do not hesitate to share with us.
We appreciate your generous and kind criticism and thoughts.
Limited by our competence, errors are inevitable.
But we will continue improving.
Thanks to the devotion of our teacher and teammates.
Special thanks to our beloved teaching assistant, without whom we would not be able to accomplish what we have now.
Salute!
